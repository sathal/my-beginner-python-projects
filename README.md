# Sathal's Python Projects Repository

## Purpose and Motivation
I come from a mainly C Programming Language background and have previous classroom experience with Java through OOP courses. I am interested in learning and gaining familiarity with the Python Programming Language now. This repository mainly serves as a place for me to store my projects as I explore the language :)


So far all of the mini projects I've completed come from the following site:

### Running list of general concepts I've been able to try in Python so far (in no particular order):
- [x] Accepting user input via command line (*See [Mad Lib Generator](https://github.com/sathal/python-projects/blob/master/1-MadLibGenerator/madLibGenerator.py#L5)*)
- [x] Formatting strings via format() method and curly braces (*See [Mad Lib Generator](https://github.com/sathal/python-projects/blob/master/1-MadLibGenerator/madLibGenerator.py#L38) - [Formatted String](https://github.com/sathal/python-projects/blob/master/1-MadLibGenerator/madLibGenerator.py#L10)*)
- [x] Use of *Random* module (*See [Number Guessing](https://github.com/sathal/python-projects/blob/master/2-NumberGuessing/numberguessing.py#L3)*)
- [x] Use of While Loops (*See [Number Guessing](https://github.com/sathal/python-projects/blob/master/2-NumberGuessing/numberguessing.py#L9)*)
